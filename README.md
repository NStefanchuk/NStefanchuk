## About Me  

Hi there! I am a **Junior Full-stack Developer** based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.  

After 6 years of experience in IT as a systems analyst, working closely with developers and cross-functional teams, I developed strong communication skills and a solid understanding of how IT systems work. Eventually, I decided to change my path and focus on building software myself.  

To make this transition, I completed the [HackYourFuture](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/) bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience with modern web technologies and built real projects in collaborative, agile teams.
